					article: "<p>Latin America contains a number of organizations listed as &quot;<a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm>Foreign Terrorist Organizations</a>&quot; (FTO) by the U.S. State Department, as well as a number of countries that are linked in some way to terrorist organizations. Every year, the U.S. and other countries spend enormous amounts of resources in the region, in both <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42582.pdf>counter-terrorism spending and foreign aid</a>. The region's stability bears significance in both the drug trade and terrorist activity.</p><p>The four FTOs in Latin America are the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC), National Liberation Army (ELN), Shining Path (SL) and United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). While all four were established with strong ideological bonds, they are now largely driven by varying motivations, especially the Latin American drug trade.</p><p>Three of these organizations, FARC, ELN and AUC, all reside in Colombia. <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/farc.html>FARC</a> originated as the paramilitary arm of the Colombian Communist Party, and is the most established of the three. It is ideologically Marxist, though its goals today differ from those of the past. Despite repeated and continued peace talks, the Colombian government is in <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://colombiareports.co/santos-send-50000-troops-farc>continuous conflict with the organization</a>.</p><p>Often seen as the smaller counterpart to FARC, ELN was founded by those inspired by Castro's communist revolution in Cuba. The two groups share similar political ideologies, both at the far left of the political spectrum, but ELN has implied a want for political representation. The two groups both <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.cfr.org/colombia/farc-eln-colombias-left-wing-guerrillas/p9272>cooperate and fight with each other</a>. Like FARC, ELN is also part of <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1953021&amp;Itemid=1>ongoing peace negotiations with the Colombian government</a>.</p><p>Formed in response to leftist organizations like FARC and ELN, AUC exists as <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=126>a collection of smaller paramilitary organizations</a>. While they originally were implicitly condoned by the Colombian military, the continuous use of illicit trade to fund activities severed ties. It vies with the other groups for control of the Colombian drug trade. But unlike the other organizations, it has had “successful” peace talks resulting in disarmament, although reports remain of active AUC groups.</p><p>The drug trade is not the only link these organizations have with the international sphere. Venezuela has often released statements supporting organizations such as FARC and ELN, as well as <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/RS21049.pdf>refusing to cooperate fully with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts</a>. This prompted an arms embargo in 2006. Other sanctions have also been imposed on specific Venezuelan individuals and companies for supporting terrorist organizations. Venezuela has also been linked to actions <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13343810>both aiding and hindering FARC</a>.</p><p>Another U.S. concern lies within Venezuela's developing relations with Iran, which in turn has ties to Hizballah, another FTO. But with the change in leadership of both countries, <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.propublica.org/article/the-terror-threat-and-irans-inroads-in-latin-america>concerns of cooperation have been reduced</a>. Iran is one of four countries listed by the State Department as &quot;State Sponsors of Terrorism,&quot; alongside another country with Latin American ties: Cuba.</p><p>Finally, Shining Path is another leftist FTO, based in Peru. It aims to completely remake Peruvian social orders according to <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=111>radical Marxist ideology</a>. Like the other Latin American FTOs, it has been reduced greatly in size and force by counter-terrorism efforts, though it still participates in <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.minnpost.com/global-post/2013/10/peru-cocaine-king-s-riches-don-t-reach-growers>Peru's drug trade</a>.</p><p>Despite improvements in government and human rights, much of Latin America still experiences political upheaval, from <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.hudson.org/files/documents/terrorism_in_latin_america.pdf>causes including terrorist organizations</a>. Change, however slow, has become more visible in recent years. Furthermore, Latin American governments have come to more publicly question <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303624004577340212625723878>U.S. drug policy in the region</a>. Various <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://gadebate.un.org/68/colombia>heads</a> of <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://gadebate.un.org/68/guatemala>state</a> have hinted that a new approach is necessary to work toward an effective solution to the illicit drug trade in the region. New dialogue between various actors in the region has shown signs of progress, from peace negotiations to discussions of new drug policy. Hopefully these discussions will lead to significant progress toward a more peaceful and stable region.</p>"

					article: "<p>Over the past three years, the Syrian civil war has claimed the lives of over 100,000 people, becoming one of the deadliest struggles in a region fraught with violence. At the center of the conflict, terrorism has played a key role as a political tool as much as a battlefield tactic in the struggle for international legitimacy.</p><p>Since the start of the uprising in 2011, many western leaders have decried President Bashir al-Assad as a brutal, dishonest dictator. In President Obama's Sept. 24 address to the United Nations, he asserted that al-Assad lost <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/09/24/read-full-text-of-obamas-speech-to-the-united-nations-on-syria-iran-and-war/ target=&quot;_blank&quot;>&quot;the legitimacy to lead a badly fractured country&quot;</a> when he &quot;slaughtered his citizens and gassed children to death&quot; on Aug. 21.</p><p>Most rebels see atrocities like the alleged use of chemical weapons as evidence of the employment of terrorism by al-Assad's government. However, some of the rebel factions, like the al-Nusra Front, are linked with al-Qaeda and other groups classified as terrorist organizations by the U.S.</p><p>To the Syrian government, the rebel groups are completely responsible for the chaos that has enveloped the country. In a speech on June 28, al-Assad claimed that the agitators fighting his forces are Islamic extremists and that <a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9363769/Bashar-al-Assad-we-will-annihilate-terrorists-in-Syria.html target=&quot;_blank&quot;>&quot;the responsibility of the Syrian government&quot;</a> is &quot;to annihilate terrorists.&quot;</p><p>In a conflict where each side is culpable for violence and civilian casualties, the issue is difficult to judge for the most astute observers. Even the term &quot;terrorism&quot; is itself a controversial topic.</p><p>Laila Ballout, an Northwestern graduate student in the Department of History studying the American intervention in the Lebanese Civil War, &quot;Terrorism, as originally defined, was basically a slander at the use of violence by any non-state actor.&quot; Nicholas Smith, an Northwestern graduate student studying Somali piracy, added, &quot;The definition of terrorism depends on your point of view. To the rebels, the government uses terrorism against civilians. To the government, it's the other way around.&quot;</p><p>Ballout noted that terrorism is also a measure of the legitimacy of violence in conflict. In the Syrian conflict, the sheer variety of groups fighting against al-Assad's regime makes it difficult to judge whose violent tactics are valid.</p><p>&quot;Part of the problem is that we know what we're against, which is the killing of civilians, but we don't know who we're for,&quot; she said. &quot;Among the rebels, you have FSA [Free Syrian Army] troops fighting with the Syrian National Council. There's also ISIS, with an Islamist focused vision, that wants to promote an Islamic caliphate and their particular vision of Islam using violence.&quot;</p><p>Since these rebel factions have little in common besides a hatred of al-Assad, it is critically important to know each group's vision of the future before intervening on their behalf.</p><p>From the perspective of the United States, choosing between these groups poses a dilemma, since many opposition fighters have also used violence against civilians. As President Obama stated, <a href=http://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/68/US_en_0.pdf target=&quot;_blank&quot;>&quot;America and others have worked to bolster the moderate opposition,&quot;</a> but &quot;extremist groups have ... taken root to exploit the crisis.&quot;</p><p>Accordingly, a victory by the Syrian rebels could be even worse than al-Assad retaining power, a serious obstacle for any country attempting to intervene.</p><p>&quot;There's no question that Al-Assad is a brutal dictator who is not concerned for the well-being of his people. Even people worried about the fall of the regime will readily admit that,&quot; Ballout said. &quot;But the solution depends on how the rebels develop, transform, or evolve as the conflict continues.&quot;</p><p>Diplomatic moves have further complicated the international community's debate over the proper response to terrorism. When al-Assad offered to give up his chemical weapon stockpile in the aftermath of an international uproar over the Aug. 21 incident, he staved off American pressure to intervene.</p><p>&quot;For all intents and purposes, al-Assad was out of time. The Americans and French wanted to start bombing, so he cooperated,&quot; Smith said.</p><p>Nevertheless, that small step of cooperation did not change the underlying brutality of the conflict. The vast majority of casualties in the conflict have not come from gas attacks, but rather bullets and bombs, and the potential for terrorism remains.</p><p>&quot;Al-Assad's use of terrorist tactics was moderated by necessity,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Accepting that he had to give up chemical weapons actually gave him more space to act.&quot;</p><p>In the wake of ongoing hostilities, the use of terrorism remains a controversial topic. Unless a permanent settlement is reached, it will remain divisive to Syrians and foreigners alike.</p><p>&quot;There is no violent way to stop the conflict. The only solution is diplomatic,&quot; Ballout said. &quot;Removing Al-Assad is very important to a lasting settlement, but it really depends on how the rebels evolve and develop a vision for the country.&quot;</p>"

			 		article: "<p>Since President Barack Obama took office in 2009, he has made fighting terrorism a national security priority. His main tactics appear to be drone strikes, <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://drones.pitchinteractive.com>especially in Pakistan</a>, Somalia and Yemen, and the United States Army Special Forces, with the most recent operations being in <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/16/world/meast/al-libi-analysis-nic-robertson/index.html>Libya</a> and Somalia.</p><p>Drone strikes have killed prominent terrorist leaders, such as <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/03/anwar-al-awlaki-what-we-learned-from-his-killing/?iref=allsearch>American-born Anwar al-Awlaki</a>, former head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Obama's emphasis on Special Forces led to operations that killed al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden and captured Abu Anas al Libi, the alleged mastermind behind the deadly bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998.</p><p>Joseph Margulies, a professor at the Northwestern University School of Law, said Obama's approach to combating terrorism differs from that of past presidents. &quot;Where Bush was a strong believer in human intelligence ... Obama is a much bigger believer in signals intelligence and electronic intelligence.&quot;</p><p>Obama has <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://drones.pitchinteractive.com>ordered up to seven times more drone strikes so far than George W. Bush did in his two terms</a>. This conflicts heavily with what both doves on the left and libertarians on the right would want from him. Weinberg professor Samuel Weber, who studies terrorism, thinks that Obama's use of drone strikes sends a very clear political message. &quot;Namely it seeks to avoid domestic criticism and opposition by limiting the number of American casualties in these conflicts,&quot; Weber said in an email. &quot;It favors short term opportunities over long-term reflection and analysis.&quot;</p><p>While these approaches have successfully killed and capture many leaders of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, they have also brought along <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/drones-dont-just-kill-their-psychological-effects-are-creating-enemies/article9707992>significant collateral damage</a>. Drone strikes often cause civilian casualties and strain ties with other countries, particularly Pakistan.</p><p>&quot;It seems clear that probably one of the major results of drone warfare is to produce determined enemies of those who are responsible for it,&quot; Weber said.</p><p>Western scholars and strategists aren't the only ones worried about the danger of drone strikes in creating enemies. <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.malalafund.org>Malala Yousafzai</a>, the girl who was targeted by the Pakistani Taliban for speaking out in support of girls' education, has made opposition to drone strikes a major part of her campaign. She believes that drone strikes do more harm than good, adopting a 'kill one, two arise' message.</p><p>Weber also believes that drone strikes are breaches of a country's sovereignty if it has not given permission - and most countries, including Pakistan, claim that no such permission was ever given. After the raid in Pakistan that killed Bin Laden, the The Pakistani government claimed it was kept out of the loop and the raid constituted <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13398281>&quot;a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty.&quot;</a></p><p>Weber says Obama's administration does not care about permission, which will lead to a major strain in diplomatic relations in addition to future terrorism.</p><p>&quot;They may accomplish short-term objectives, but they often lay the groundwork for much more serious and widespread long-term conflicts,&quot; Weber said. &quot;As a result, the U.S. will find itself increasingly in the position of trying to play the world's policeman, despite Obama's protests to the contrary.&quot;</p><p>Margulies said Obama sends special military units out with a different goal than past presidents. &quot;When we pick up (capture) people, Bush would render them to third countries, whereas the Obama administration will bring them back here to the criminal justice system.&quot; Al Libi is currently in New York facing charges for the embassy bombings.</p><p>Special Operations missions, such as those against Bin Laden and Al Libi, seem to be better options for going against specific high-value targets than drone strikes. While they carry along a risk for high political repercussions, the risk of civilian casualties is significantly lower, resulting in fewer terrorists to fight.</p><p>While Bush's foreign policy was centered around two major wars, Obama's focuses on more widespread, unconventional means. &quot;The Bush administration believed in a large footprint with a large U.S. military presence in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama leaves a much smaller footprint in many more places,&quot; Margulies said.</p><p>The Obama administration has shown that it prefers small-scale, intermittent attacks that focus on short-term goals. Weber would like to see a big-scale solution - but not on the battlefield. &quot;What would be helpful, by contrast, would be a large-scale public discussion, not just among academics or specialists, that would take into account such historical factors and that would also be open to self-criticism where called for.&quot;</p><p>The question is just how to get the discussion started.</p>"

					article: "<p>Terrorism in East Africa is not easy to define. Unlike other terrorist groups blacklisted by the Central Intelligence Agency, like Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, Somalia's Al-Shabaab, the region's foremost terrorist organization, does not fit the standard definitions of terrorism, because its regional role is too complex.</p><p>The CIA defines a &quot;terrorist group&quot; as <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/cia-the-war-on-terrorism/terrorism-faqs.html>&quot;any group that practices, or has significant subgroups that practice ... premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups.&quot;</a></p><p>This vague definition is too simple to helpfully address certain forms of terrorism. When it labels groups like Al-Shabaab as terrorists, the government entangles itself in a much more complex issue. Al-Shabaab is not necessarily a subnational group. It has effectively become a de-facto extension of the Somali government.</p><p>The official Somali government does not hold much sway. Following the retraction of U.S. aid to the region in 1991 at the close of the Cold War, the central government collapsed, but no single political group could centralize power. Somalia is fragmented among Somaliland, Puntland, Galmudug, Saylac and Lughaya State, Awdalland, Himan and Heeb, Khatumo State, and Jubaland. These autonomous regions create a vacuum that allows terrorist groups like Al-Shabaab to thrive.</p><p>These divisions led to violence between the warring states and famine throughout the country. In 1991 and 1992, the fighting in Somalia's capital city of Mogadishu killed around 25,000 people and displaced millions more. These conflicts disrupted transportation and infrastructure, creating a famine that persists today.</p><p>These events play into the Al-Shabaab's narrative that &quot;religious identity is an antidote to the divisions in Somalia has suffered up until this point. Religion can replace these clan divisions.&quot; This gives the organization influence and political clout throughout the country as people turn to any stabilizing force. Al-Shabaab has integrated itself into the political framework of Somalia, policing certain areas and setting up Sharia courts. This role is similar to the Taliban's in Pakistan. With the government unable to redress Somali grievances, they turn to Al-Shabaab for predictability and stability.</p><p>&quot;The state cannot provide justice to people. It can't resolve civil cases. So classically, what Al-Shabaab has done in go into areas and try to solve the problems,&quot; says professor William Reno, Director of Northwestern University's African studies program, who has travelled to Somalia many times.</p><p>David Kilcullen, who spoke at Northwestern University earlier in October, argues in his book <i>Out of the Mountains: The Coming Age of the Urban Guerilla</i> that such appeals to safety are fish traps. The bait seems inviting, but once a Somalian town takes it, the hook of Al-Shabaab make it difficult to escape. In this way, Al-Shabaab <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15336689>effectively governs most of rural Somalia.</a></p><p>If Al-Shabaab has taken the reins of governance in the region, attacks on neighboring states do not easily qualify as terrorist attacks. Al-Shabaab militants <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/28/world/africa/kenya-mall-attack>cut off noses and hung hostages early September in the Westgate shopping mall attack</a>, and the group <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/illegal-ivory-trade-funds-alshabaabs-terrorist-attacks-8861315.html>bombed several US embassies in Kenya in 1998</a>. Within Somalia, Al-Shabaab use the Sharia courts they installed to impress their own agenda.</p><p>Such events reflect the complicated role Al-Shabaab plays in East Africa. While Kenya condemns the terrorist organization, the group cannot fall under that title because it has become the de facto ruling structure of much of Somalia.</p><p>Within this informal political group, however, divisions about the group's focus have arisen. While the nationalist wing of Al-Shabaab focuses on local politics, the internationalist wing believes the solution to Somalia's problems lies in creating and uniting a pan-Islamic community. This has led some parts of the network to fund Al-Qaeda, coming in indirect contact with the West's war on terror.</p><p>These two wings have come into conflict over <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/09/20129189151922935.html>a battle for Kismayo</a>, a city by the Southern coast of Somalia. As government and African Union peacekeeping units pressured Al-Shabaab to surrender the city, the nationalists entered into negotiations as the city's local officials.</p><p>The internationalist group's position was weakened, and Professor Reno argues that terror attacks in Kenya by this wing were power plays aimed at reasserting the group's international focus in the regional politics of East Africa. While the domestic wing of Al-Shabaab is interested in building political power through wide appeals to moderation, the international wing pursues its goals with violence and ideological rigidity. These differing visions divide Al-Shabaab without any coherent focus. They are not a political party, nor are they a terrorist organization.</p><p>Somalia is a country where, as Professor Reno concludes, &quot;It's just bad politicians and bad politics involved in conflicts that don't help anybody.&quot; A hatred for the West does not empower Al-Shabaab to commit acts of terrorism. Instability does.</p>"

U.S-designated terrorist groups operating in AfPak (a <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com>popular</a>, but no longer <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/01/20/team_obama_scuttles_the_term_afpak>official</a>, way to refer to the two countries as a single theater) take advantage of the porous border between the two.

Though the AfPak terrorist groups are diverse, ranging from the <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.cfr.org/afghanistan/taliban-afghanistan/p10551>deposed Afghan Taliban</a> to the longstanding <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/glance-pakistan-based-haqqani-network>Pakistan-based Haqqani Network</a>, they share several commonalities. First, they draw primarily from the rural <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/apr/03/afghanistan-war-against-pashtuns>Pashtun communities</a> they hide in.

Their recruiting also leans heavily on <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://nation.time.com/2013/05/01/insurgentswith-a-cause>resentment</a> of occupation forces.</p><p>U.S. and NATO, as part of their efforts to prepare to leave Afghanistan after 2014, have attempted to change how the insurgency in Afghanistan is fought. This has included <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2013/0111/Afghanistan-The-challenge-of-good-vs-bad-militias>training militias</a> to police remote areas of the country, as well as the now well-known use of drone strikes in Pakistan.</p><p>However, these strategies, regardless of their success in fighting insurgency forces, have been extremely successful in rousing the ire of rural Afghans as well as politicians in Kabul. <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/the-real-reasons-karzai-wants-us-troops-out/273528>Poorly-regulated militias</a> and <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/drone-attacks-pakistan-counterproductive-report>drone strike with high civilian casualties</a> fuel recruiting for the Afghan insurgency and make U.S.-Afghan relations ever more strained.</p><p>Outside of the AfPak theater, discussions of Middle Eastern U.S.-designated terrorist organizations inevitably tie back to a single name: Al Qaeda. The transnational Islamist group seeks to <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations-and-networks/al-qaeda-k-al-qaida-al-qaida/p9126>remove western influence</a> from the Middle Eastern sphere and replace secular governments with fundamentalist ones.

Using its &quot;brand&quot; and <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/05/02/bin-ladens-gone-but-what-about-al-qaedas-finances>worldwide financial web</a>, Al Qaeda bolsters local insurgencies like venture capitalists of violence.

There, a <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/yemen>weak transitional government</a> has created an opening for Al Qaeda to implement its program and attempt to put in place an Islamist regime. Because political Islam has traditionally been <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://acmcu.georgetown.edu/135400.html>perceived as a threat</a> by the United States and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has proven itself <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2013/0807/With-AQAP-s-strategy-unclear-Yemen-struggles-to-respond>dangerous but unpredictable</a>, the United States is concerned with the threat AQAP poses. A plot last year to <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-05-09/world/35456649_1_underwear-bomb-bomb-plot-al-qaeda>blow up several U.S.-bound planes</a> confirmed that while AQAP might have the removal of western influence from the Arabian Peninsula as its goal, it does not feel it must restrict itself to regional action.</p><p>Despite U.S. efforts, Al Qaeda continues to thrive. Part of Al Qaeda's longevity is its extremely effective recruiting. The State Department, in partnership with other nations, has attempted to counter this by establishing a <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/09/214853.htm>global fund</a> to combat extremist views in the Muslim world. The efficacy of such a program is <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/10/15/strings_attached_countering_violent_extremism?page=0,1>up for debate</a>, but the underlying policy goal is clear.</p><p>The major problem the United States faces in fighting these groups is that while it might seek to reduce the influence of extremists, it can do little to alleviate the problems that make such extremism so attractive. Poverty and worldwide economic problems are, after all, difficult to fight in a concrete way, and when the U.S. attempts to combat terrorist groups in the Middle East directly - as it feels it must - it frequently only makes matters worse.</p><p>To fight these groups, the United States now makes heavy use of drone strikes, which both kill insurgents and reduce the danger to U.S. forces. Yet a growing <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/usa-must-be-held-account-drone-killings-pakistan-2013-10-22>litany</a> of <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/12/is-u-s-drone-policy-creating-more-terrorists-than-its-killing>voices</a> contend that not only are drone strikes too harmful to civilian populations, they may be <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139454/audrey-kurth-cronin/why-drones-fail>creating more terrorists than they kill</a>.</p><p>The Middle East and South Asia form a broad, complicated region. Though terrorist organizations there are usually marked by their opposition to U.S. foreign policy and - at least further west - their connection to Al Qaeda, that very opposition means attempts to combat them help sustain them. There is no silver bullet for terrorism in the Middle East, and drones especially may create more problems than they purport to solve. Perhaps if the United States wants to solve its problems in the region, it may want to start by abandoning bullets altogether.</p>"
